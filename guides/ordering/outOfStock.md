# List Of Components That Go Out Of Stock And Alternative Sources

## Selecting alternatives

Please note that JLCPCB and LCSC will often run out of stock on certain components. There is a chance you may have to find an alternative component with the same footprint and properties. Check below to see if there are alternatives listed for your part.  If not, post a [github issue](https://github.com/shamansystems/Cheap-FOCer-2/issues) of where you found a new part so that others can see and we can update [this page](outOfStock.md).  

## JST-PH(b2b,b3b,b6b,b7b) connectors

Be sure to get JST-PH not JST-XHP because the pin spacing is different. They look like this:
